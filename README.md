# DragN's VV: Refueled

Combining the features of both the [Ultimate&nbsp;Car&nbsp;Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ultimate-car-mod) and [DragN's&nbsp;Valiant&nbsp;Vehicles](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dragns-valiant-vehicles) into one

---

For the record, this mod _doesn't_ add new vehicles, only modifies DragN's vehicles
<br>
Dependencies: `Ultimate Car Mod @ 1.0.32+`, `DragN's Valiant Vehicles @ 1.3+`, `Forge @ 47.3.0+`

### Notable features

- Fueling and battery system
- On wall and entity collision mechanics 
<br> &emsp;&emsp;\+ an explosion on vehicle death
- Exhaust particles
- Additional configurable parameters

#### TODO:

- Create custom vehicle sounds
- Model in and add a gas station block
- Make custom models for to-be-made items: canister, battery and repair kit
- Additionally add a new fluid to be used as fuel
- Implement a way to remove the vehicles without having to effectively kill them
